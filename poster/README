Scientific poster template for Asymptote.

For a landscape poster, compile with 

asy -f pdf poster.asy

The file posterportrait.asy gives a portrait orientation.  Both are
set up for A0 paper sizes.


The content of the boxes is defined in the tex0[] array, with samples
given.  Colours of the boxes are given by boxpen and roundpen, which
can be changed.  A background image can be added by uncommenting the
appropriate two lines in the .asy files.  If the background image format is
not eps, one must pass pdflatex as the tex compiler to asymptote:

asy -f pdf -tex pdflatex poster.asy
