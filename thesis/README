This subversion repository contains a basic thesis template for math/stats
graduate students at the University of Alberta.  Efforts have been made
to ensure that this complies with current FGSR guidelines, but we can't 
guarantee that we match them exactly; it is your responsibility to ensure
that this be the case.

This repository is maintained by the math/stat graduate student association.

Instructions:

This template expects pdflatex (as opposed to latex).  The basic commands are:

Copy all the files to your own directory.  (Don't turn the thesis
template subversion repository into your thesis!)  You might want to
rename thesistemplate.tex <your name>_thesis.tex or thesis.tex or
something like that.

Once you have done that, you can compile the document by running the
following command:

  latexmk thesis

which produces a dvi, or

  latexmk -pdf thesis

to produce a pdf.  This can also be done using various TeX editors.
