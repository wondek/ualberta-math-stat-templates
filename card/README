Business card example created by Malcolm Roberts, 2011.

This uses asymptote (asymptote.sf.net) to create a PDF that should
match most commonly available pre-perforated business card paper
things that you can buy at office supply stores.

This has been tested on an HP Lasterjet 2200D using Geographics
Business Cards, but may have to be adjusted for other printers and
other pre-perforated business card paper. Adjust the values of bx0 and
by0 in bcard.asy to change the size of the cards, and change the
values of xoff0 and yoff0 to change the page margins.

To create the pdf file, first creat the logo file by typing
   asy logo
in the command-line (or whatever one does in Windows) and then
create the pdf by typing
   asy -f pdf bcard

in the command-line. Once you're happy with how cards fit the paper,
comment out the line that says "draw(b);" by making it read
"//draw(b);".  Then, print!
